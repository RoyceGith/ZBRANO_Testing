## ZBRANO v0.13.250

ZBRANO combines Home Assistant chat, voice, entity control, memory, notifications,
calendar and contact tools, plugins, and evidence-based automations. Automation Studio now uses
a visual building-block toolbox, interactive node canvas, and contextual inspector;
the established automation engine and stored definitions remain compatible.

Version 0.13.250 fixes Shared Files upload and folder deletion, adds an in-page
delete confirmation, and refreshes the file browser for desktop and phone.

Version 0.13.249 adds complete GitHub and Gmail Direct setup guides. Open
Plugins, find either plugin in Catalog or Installed, and select Setup guide.
The Gmail guide includes the exact callback URL for your installation.

Version 0.13.248 restores the original attachment and voice control space,
with only a modest desktop prompt-row width reduction.

Version 0.13.247 centers a narrower prompt box beneath the chat while preserving
the existing attachment, microphone, stop and send arrangement.

Version 0.13.246 uses right-aligned cyan user prompts and open assistant
replies within a centered conversation column.

Version 0.13.245 centers user and assistant messages in one shared reading
column so the conversation stays together in a full-width window.

Version 0.13.244 places icon-only Copy controls below messages on the right,
with hover labels and a pencil to load user prompts into the composer for editing.

Version 0.13.243 restores an open chat layout without message cards, keeping
readable spacing, author labels and Copy actions.

Version 0.13.242 improves conversation keyboard navigation, announces the current
chat, and restores focus after renaming or copying messages.

Version 0.13.241 separates user messages and assistant replies with subtle surfaces,
comfortable reading widths, and author labels above the text on desktop and phone.

Version 0.13.240 adds compact Copy message actions to completed and saved chat
messages, preserving the original text and showing clear clipboard feedback.

Version 0.13.239 adds local Settings search with category context, keyboard
navigation and a highlighted control when opening a result.

Version 0.13.238 adds natural name, room and availability sorting for device
cards, plus a saved Favorites first option in More.

Version 0.13.237 adds local conversation-title search, a clear no-matches state,
and a Latest messages shortcut when reading earlier replies.

Version 0.13.236 adds matching mobile navigation icons, carries new activity
indicators into the More menu, and enlarges chat controls for touch.

Version 0.13.235 adds mobile bottom navigation and a More menu, clearer device state
badges, simplified cards, verified action confirmations and consistent control styling.

Version 0.13.234 refreshes saved conversation rows with rounded selection styling
and consistent action icons, and renames the Entities navigation tab to Devices.

Version 0.13.233 moves entity states to the right of device cards and gives them
a stronger weight for easier scanning.

Version 0.13.232 matches livingroom and living room consistently, including aircondition
and air conditioner. Direct control requires the requested room and device to match.

Version 0.13.231 adds Allow and sensor/control access directly to each device card,
with wider rectangular cards and single-line names. Grouped device controls keep
sensors read-only and preserve separate permissions in the details panel.

Version 0.13.230 organizes Entities into room navigation and device cards, with
favorites, quick filters, and individual entity permissions, aliases, and history.
The detailed table remains available for advanced review.

Version 0.13.229 removes the composer plugin count button and shows catalog entries
immediately while refreshing the registry in the background, without delaying Installed.

Version 0.13.228 restores complete, centered plugin icons beneath chat and lets you
scroll through every installed plugin on desktop and phone.

Version 0.13.227 embeds the GitHub mark directly in the composer so it cannot become
an empty box behind Home Assistant ingress or during cached asset loading.

Version 0.13.226 reliably loads the real GitHub plugin icon beneath chat, falls back
cleanly if an asset fails, and preserves icon contrast across interface themes.

Version 0.13.225 keeps every installed plugin visible beneath the prompt, including
disabled connections in a clear muted state.

Version 0.13.224 replaces the crowded composer dropdown row with compact AI and voice controls
and keeps enabled plugins readable in a bounded status strip.

Version 0.13.223 completes explicit Memory Database saves without repeated approvals,
preserving the original content while the user chooses its destination.

Version 0.13.222 moves Notifications into Settings, exposes its views directly in
the Settings sidebar, and gives Entities, Plugins, and Calendar consistent section navigation.

Version 0.13.221 correctly recognizes stateless notification endpoints and adds
a guided, private Telegram BotFather-to-Home-Assistant setup inside Notifications.

Version 0.13.220 reorganizes Notifications into a clear, contained delivery
workspace with responsive cards, forms, Watchlist, and Delivery Logs.

Version 0.13.219 allows previously unconfigured lights, switches, climate controls,
and clearly identified air-conditioner controls by default while preserving every
explicit user choice.

Version 0.13.218 restores one-click GitHub account connection in Plugins and
prevents the official GitHub card from requesting a manual PAT.

Version 0.13.217 opens fresh installations in the Light interface theme while
preserving any Light, Dark, or Gray choice already saved by an existing user.

Version 0.13.216 completes the ZBRANO identity migration and removes Playwright
from the customer runtime and built-in tools.

Version 0.13.215 removes Developer Mode from customer builds, disables its saved
state and external API routes, and keeps the safe Installation Report available
for support.

Version 0.13.214 adds an opt-in native Home Assistant Assist conversation agent
for microphone satellites, secured by local pairing and duplicate-request protection
without changing existing pipelines.

Version 0.13.213 saves automatically organized memories as clean document
sections, preserves lists and headings, removes repeated titles, and upgrades
older list-wrapped entries when they are opened.

Version 0.13.212 refreshes About as a complete eight-part product showcase for
conversation, home control, automation, memory, files, services, personalization,
and owner-controlled safety.

Version 0.13.211 gives Shared Files a polished library layout with refined
actions, surfaces, folder and file icons, metadata, and responsive behavior.

Version 0.13.210 adds folders to Shared Files, including nested navigation,
uploading into the open folder, and moving existing files between folders.

Version 0.13.209 compacts the My Memory landing page so saved spaces begin near
the top, with smaller labels, counters, and cards.

Version 0.13.208 displays memory notes with chat-style Markdown formatting and
shows each note's last-updated date in the list, reader, and formatted printout.

Version 0.13.207 prints the memory space name as a smaller, clean document heading
without the interface's decorative greater-than sign.

Version 0.13.206 removes the excessive blank gap between a memory note title and
its content while preserving the large editor workspace.

Version 0.13.205 opens the first note immediately, keeps other memory categories
available in a compact top switcher, and gives the note editor more usable space.

Version 0.13.204 suggests useful broad and specific collections before saving,
such as **Soup Recipes** or **Beef Soup Recipes**. My Memory now opens into a
larger note-focused editor with compact controls, editable note titles and
categories, clean names without `.md`, and note printing.

Version 0.13.203 gives automatically saved knowledge descriptive topic collections.
Soup content goes to `Soup Recipes`, related existing collections offer one clear
append-or-create choice, and every completed save reports its exact destination.

Version 0.13.202 correctly removes the final saved conversation before showing a
fresh unsaved chat, preventing a stale deleted row and the apparent double deletion.

Version 0.13.201 treats an explicit request to save information in Memory Database
as authorization for that exact save. Ordinary saves complete in one operation;
large saves announce their bounded phase count before writing.

Version 0.13.200 preserves the original Markdown formatting when a streamed answer
is stopped and saves the partial response with a discreet stopped marker.

Version 0.13.199 renames the technical `remember_automatically` chat action to
the clear **Save to Memory Database** label in tool requests and approval prompts.

Version 0.13.198 isolates optional remote MCP connectors from ordinary chat. A
failed or unavailable connector can no longer prevent normal questions, recipes,
Home Assistant commands, web searches, or built-in Memory requests from working.

Version 0.13.197 makes Memory effortless for ordinary users: write one natural
sentence and ZBRANO chooses the area, reuses or creates the right space, files it
in a useful note, and avoids duplicates. Manual organization remains optional.

Version 0.13.196 restores reliable vertical scrolling throughout Memory Database
and Template Studio, including creation and editing forms on desktop and compact
screens.

Version 0.13.195 makes Memory Studio's setup choices distinct: categories now
answer what a space is for, while the next step offers only relevant organizational
layouts such as Household organizer, Work notebook, or Project tracker.

Version 0.13.194 turns that built-in memory into a friendly Memory Studio. A
dedicated Memory Database organizes custom categories, spaces, and notes, while
Template Studio lets each user create reusable note-card layouts for their own
life and work. The complete database remains local and included in backups.

Version 0.13.193 replaces the external Workshop Memory dependency with built-in
Knowledge Memory. Users create their own spaces for Home, Work, Study, Recipes,
Projects, or any custom purpose; notes remain local, approval-gated, searchable,
and included in backup and restore. Existing remote project notes can be imported
once during upgrade, after which ZBRANO no longer depends on that server or tunnel.

Version 0.13.192 adds bring-your-own AI through OpenRouter alongside direct OpenAI.
Users supply their own provider key and can choose from OpenRouter's available model
catalog without ZBRANO operating or billing a managed AI service. Direct Home
Assistant commands remain local and fast; OpenRouter chat supports local ZBRANO
tools, while OpenAI-only web search and remote plugins are clearly identified.

Version 0.13.191 makes wake-word portability explicit: browser recognition is the
recommended method for every user, while the bundled owner-tuned local model is
clearly marked experimental. The selector preserves existing choices, and personal
calibration now explains that it reduces false activations rather than retraining
the base wake phrase.

Version 0.13.190 distinguishes real controllable devices from their status,
temperature, and mode helper entities. Air-conditioner power requests now prefer
the actual climate/thermostat entity instead of presenting sensor helpers as
equally valid devices.

Version 0.13.189 sends clear Home Assistant on/off requests through the local
control route before preparing AI or Workshop tools. It selects approved Control
Devices without being confused by similarly named sensors, asks locally when more
than one device matches, and never repeats a successful WebSocket action during
state verification.

Version 0.13.188 adds a compact flag selector to the top-right header and makes
the saved choice apply only to interface text and locale-aware dates. ZBRANO now
answers in the language used in each message, while browser speech recognition
uses the device locale independently.

Version 0.13.187 expands localization across Automation Studio, Setup, About,
Calendar, Contacts, Notifications, Plugins, Entities, and Developer controls. A
second checked-in catalog covers hundreds of interface phrases, selected-language
date formatting follows the interface choice, dynamic accessibility text is
translated, and the container build now rejects incomplete catalog structure.

Version 0.13.186 begins ZBRANO's multilingual interface rollout with English,
Greek, Italian, and French. It adds automatic device-language detection, a saved
language selector, live translation of core navigation and controls, and complete
Home Assistant configuration translations without altering user content or stored
automations.

Version 0.13.185 adds `amd64` alongside `aarch64`, allowing the same validated
ZBRANO release to install on modern 64-bit Home Assistant PCs, servers, virtual
machines, and ARM systems. The existing generic GHCR image now publishes a true
two-platform manifest without changing the app slug, update path, or stored data.

Version 0.13.184 gives ZBRANO a dedicated Home Assistant store icon and matching
transparent wordmark. Public-boundary validation now checks their exact dimensions,
PNG format, transparency, and bounded file size before publication.

Version 0.13.183 turns the public Home Assistant pages into concise product and
installation guides. Capabilities, requirements, permissions, privacy, upgrades,
and support are now easy to understand, while detailed history stays in the
changelog and the Home Assistant store description reflects the complete product.

Version 0.13.182 adds a polished top-level About showcase. It organizes ZBRANO's
existing conversation, home awareness, automation, memory, connected-service, and
safety features into a responsive product page with direct paths to Chat, Setup,
Device Access, and Automations.

Version 0.13.181 makes Home Assistant's ZBRANO Configuration screen understandable.
Every option now has a friendly name and explanation covering required, optional,
advanced, protected, and legacy fields. Release checks require complete option
translations and now validate the actual thin public repository passed to them.

Version 0.13.180 gives the Home Assistant setup step its own connection-recovery
guide instead of sending users to Device Access. It explains the automatic
Supervisor connection, where to check app status and logs, and provides a direct
connection recheck without asking users for an address or token.

Version 0.13.179 aligns onboarding with the Sensor device and Control device model.
Setup now calls the step Device access, reports plainly how many of each are selected,
and explains that ZBRANO can still chat—but cannot read or control the home—when
the owner chooses no devices.

Version 0.13.178 makes Entity Inventory permission-first. Allow, Device or sensor,
Current value, How ZBRANO may use it, and Room now appear before technical details.
Custom layouts remain intact, Reset columns uses the new order, and choosing a
permission category reveals its table from the top-left without a crowded guide.

Version 0.13.177 makes entity permission controls agree with each other. Choosing
Do not allow now revokes access everywhere, while checking a blocked entity selects
its safest readable level. Restricted entities cannot be counted, exported, or
stored as enabled, including through direct API requests.

Version 0.13.176 replaces internal entity-policy names with clear Sensor device,
Control device, and Do not allow choices. Air-conditioning status and temperature
sensors are now always recommended for reading, never device control, while old
saved access values remain compatible until deliberately changed.

Version 0.13.175 requires explicit selection before any newly discovered socket,
thermostat, HVAC entity, or other device receives ZBRANO access. Existing saved
permissions remain compatible and can now be revoked normally. Device heuristics
only recommend an access level; inventory loading never grants it.

Version 0.13.174 adds safe Sensor, Control, and All entity permission views with
live installation counts and no bulk approval.

Version 0.13.173 replaces the AI model setup dead end with a four-step Home
Assistant configuration guide while keeping credential entry in Home Assistant.

Version 0.13.172 adds a shareable Installation Report to completed Setup. It checks
core and optional connections, storage, backup availability, permission counts,
and automation safety totals without exposing private configuration.

Version 0.13.167 completes the onboarding handoff. Finishing Setup now shows a
clear ZBRANO is ready screen, separates capabilities that are ready from those
available later, and offers direct Start chatting and Review connections actions.

Version 0.13.166 turns first-run Setup into a focused guided wizard. One clearly
explained task is shown at a time, a compact seven-step rail shows progress, and
future steps remain locked until required Home Assistant and AI checks genuinely
pass. Every step keeps direct Check and Configure actions.

Version 0.13.165 completes the owner-extension separation. Grinder-specific
settings no longer appear in the general Home Assistant add-on configuration or
startup environment. The private Grinder runtime continues using the protected
configuration migrated into `/data` by v0.13.164.

Version 0.13.164 safely migrates an enabled or customized owner-only Grinder
monitor configuration from public add-on options into protected persistent
storage. The runtime now prefers that private configuration, preparing the old
product-facing fields for removal without losing the owner's working setup.

Version 0.13.163 removes the automation-wide response choice from Setup. Every
IF or ELSE IF path with device tasks now independently chooses whether to ask
before running or run automatically. Message-only paths simply notify and do
not show an irrelevant approval setting.

Version 0.13.162 makes Automation Studio warnings belong to the exact incomplete
card, instead of making every IF and ELSE IF card say Needs attention. Each
automation can now pause during its own sleep hours, while security automations
can be explicitly allowed to run during those hours. Power tasks also derive the
correct Home Assistant command from the selected device.

Version 0.13.161 turns each branch message into an optional task block. New ELSE
IF paths start empty, and a path can contain a message only, device tasks only,
or both. Message-only paths notify without asking for approval for a nonexistent
device action.

Version 0.13.160 fixes nested task device selection so choosing a Home Assistant
entity replaces the partial search text and the flow card displays its complete
friendly name. Partial queries can no longer be saved as configured devices.

Version 0.13.159 moves message delivery into each IF and ELSE IF branch. Every
branch can independently say its message aloud, show it in ZBRANO notifications,
or send it through Home Assistant notifications. The redundant This path runs
when selector is removed; all checks inside a branch are joined with AND.

Version 0.13.158 removes the duplicate editable IF and ELSE IF title cards, so
each branch begins directly with its own device or sensor condition. Speaking
branches now keep separate required messages, Monitor silently removes messages,
and task menus open upward when they are near the bottom of the Studio window.

Version 0.13.157 restores current readings in every Automation Studio device
dropdown. Results show the entity name and ID beside a clear state or measured
value badge, including sensor units and current climate temperatures.

Version 0.13.156 makes IF and ELSE IF device checks use the selected entity's
state by default. Optional Home Assistant attributes are preserved in a collapsed
advanced section instead of showing a confusing Which value field.

Version 0.13.155 makes Automation Studio more spacious by moving Setup & safety
and the guided-step progress into a slim line above the block palette. The top
palette now contains only real flow blocks, and its main action buttons are smaller.

Version 0.13.154 keeps Power turns on and Power turns off selected for every
entity that reports an on/off state. Power events now show only the device and
optional duration, without redundant action and comparison fields.

Version 0.13.153 moves Automation Studio's block toolbox above the canvas and
groups shortcuts into WHEN Events, IF Conditions, THEN Actions, and ELSE IF
Paths. IF starts a condition group; AND/OR connects additional conditions.

Version 0.13.152 adapts response choices to the selected device type. Sensor
devices offer Monitor silently or Notify me; Control devices offer Ask me first
or Do it automatically, removing overlapping authority wording.

Version 0.13.151 replaces abstract device-risk levels with two direct choices:
Sensor device for read-only observation and Control device for automations that
can change something. Action-only safety settings now appear only when relevant.

Version 0.13.150 adds a per-automation Require presence gate to Setup & safety
and replaces the optional-results prompt with direct IF / ELSE IF paths. Adding
the first ELSE IF keeps existing And checks and Then tasks connected in the
first path, while each new path has its own check, message, and task.

Version 0.13.149 gives every When block a clear event type: Sensor, Power on,
Power off, Time, Sun, Repeat, or One time. Selecting a flow card now shows only
that block's settings. Automatic automations no longer display disconnected Say
cards or message controls.

Version 0.13.148 stabilizes the aarch64 image build by testing Undo against a
deliberately committed edit and waiting for persisted recovery state instead
of CPU-dependent timing. Application behavior is unchanged from v0.13.147.

Version 0.13.147 puts safety and authority directly in Step 1 of every
automation. Each rule now clearly chooses whether ZBRANO watches, suggests,
asks first, or acts automatically, together with its impact and safety limits.
The global authority screen is removed from normal navigation while built-in
protections remain underneath as a hard ceiling.

Version 0.13.146 repairs Automation Studio save feedback. Name and purpose
validation now matches the server before submission, and any structured server
validation response is translated into readable field-specific messages instead
of `[object Object]`.

Version 0.13.145 makes the optional final Automation Studio step understandable
without removing the visual flow. It asks whether another situation needs a
different result, then presents each result as plain When / Then content with an
explicit fallback. The branching engine and existing saved automations remain
compatible.

Version 0.13.144 stabilizes the ARM image browser gate by waiting for the
debounced Automation Studio history snapshot itself before testing Undo. This
removes a builder-speed race without changing application behavior.

Version 0.13.143 makes Then task-first for new automations. Common users choose
icon-based actions such as Turn on, Set temperature, Notify, or Wait without
seeing raw Home Assistant commands. Custom commands remain available through an
Advanced disclosure, and flow cards and confirmations use friendly action names.

Version 0.13.142 turns the Studio guide into a true guided setup. New automations
begin at Name it, Back and Next controls lead through all five steps, and required
information is explained before the user can continue. The final step points to
safe testing or saving while direct canvas and drag-and-drop editing remain intact.

Version 0.13.141 turns the numbered Automation Studio steps into a live guide.
Required steps show Ready or Needs attention, while optional steps show their
current check, task, or outcome count. Validation, saved-automation summaries,
and activation confirmation now use everyday language instead of internal terms.

Version 0.13.140 continues the Automation Studio usability reconstruction. Every
additional When, Only if, and Then card now explains each field in everyday
language. Confidence tuning and safety limits stay available inside discreet
expandable sections, alternate paths are consistently called Outcomes, and the
main actions now say New automation, Try it safely, and Save automation.

Version 0.13.139 begins the Automation Studio usability reconstruction without
removing its flow. A numbered Name → When → Only if → Then → Outcomes guide now
sits beside the interactive canvas. Flow cards use device-aware icons, friendly
names, and concise symbols such as `> 26 °C`; advanced behavior remains available
under plain-language labels and existing automation definitions stay compatible.

Version 0.13.138 fixes entity selection for additional Automation Studio triggers.
Clicking a second or later Trigger card now focuses that trigger's relevant field
and loads its Home Assistant entity picker instead of focusing the generic type selector.

Version 0.13.137 replaces circular arrival halos with brief electrical sparkles.
Signals now finish as a tiny four-point flash centered on the destination neuron,
without drawing extra circles or rings around it.

Version 0.13.136 removes the remaining blue tint from resting neuron interiors.
Every theme now uses an equal-channel neutral grayscale core, while blue remains
limited to connections, outlines, moving signals, and their arrival halos.

Version 0.13.135 gives each arriving neural signal a distinct destination flash.
The neuron briefly lights with a compact warm-white core and a small blue halo,
making the firing event readable without brightening the resting node interior.

Version 0.13.134 makes neural firing visible without making the backdrop noisy.
Connection impulses now render above the neuron bodies, arrive more regularly, and
produce a clearer inner-node flash. Neuron centers use a more neutral charcoal to
slightly reduce their blue tint.

Version 0.13.133 adds discreet neural firing signals to the active backdrop. A small
number of faint impulses travel along existing connections and briefly illuminate
their destination nodes, while the v0.13.132 pause rules keep active chats and text
selection free from animation work.

Version 0.13.132 stops the neural backdrop animation as soon as a chat begins and
the nodes return to their configured visibility. It also pauses the animation while
chat text is selected and whenever the chat is hidden, eliminating competing canvas
work without removing the static neural image.

Version 0.13.131 replaces the remaining green interface palette with the same
theme-aware blue used by the Talk button. Primary accents, glows, controls,
background tints, status highlights, and the animated neural backdrop now use one
consistent blue family across dark, light, and gray themes.

Version 0.13.130 makes the visual workflow match its real logic: a compact watcher
stage wakes the automation, followed by explicit IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE paths.
Every condition now exposes its entity, state or attribute, operator, required or
comparison value, and sustained duration. Existing saved automations remain compatible.

Version 0.13.128 repairs the container browser gate on slower ARM builders by
making an Automation Studio delete interaction deterministic. Application behavior
and stored data are unchanged from v0.13.127.

Version 0.13.127 turns Birthdays into a single People directory with the next
birthdays at the top and colored month sections below. Birthdays saved through
chat now default to reminders one week and one day before, including saves made
through a linked Contact; existing reminder choices are preserved.

Version 0.13.126 keeps recurring Birthday cards intact when reminder notifications
are delivered. Reminder results now merge into current storage, and a linked Contact
can safely restore a missing Birthday record without losing the Contact.

Version 0.13.125 keeps an automation's Objective separate from its process task.
New flows now ask for an actual suggestion or task in the Do This card instead of
incorrectly repeating the Objective.

Version 0.13.124 simplifies Automation Studio into plain Check, If, and Do steps,
renames the visible Context block to Condition, removes explanatory clutter from
process cards, and shows each entity's complete friendly name and entity ID.

Version 0.13.123 restores searchable Home Assistant entity pickers for Context
presence, Context signals, and Action entities in Automation Studio. Contacts now
appears immediately to the right of Calendar in primary navigation.

Version 0.13.122 restores independent Contacts scrolling and adds remembered
Cards, List, and Compact directory arrangements without changing contact data.

Version 0.13.121 makes the container browser gate deterministic by explicitly
marking the exercised notification as read before asserting the unread badge.
Application behavior and stored data are unchanged.

Version 0.13.120 repairs Google Contacts import failures. Google People API or
permission problems now return an actionable message instead of HTTP 500, malformed
individual records are skipped without cancelling the whole import, and fields
already stored locally are preserved when Google does not provide replacements.

Version 0.13.119 adds the Contacts directory, CSV/vCard and read-only Google imports,
Birthday synchronization, and numbered chat disambiguation.

The application source and post-split build history are maintained in the private
core repository. Public Home Assistant repositories contain only the eight-file
installer and update metadata needed to deliver the prebuilt image.

ZBRANO v0.13.56 reconnects the thin public installer branch to the last previously public source commit so Home Assistant Supervisor can fast-forward its cached repository checkout and detect updates without uninstalling.

ZBRANO v0.13.18 prevents Release Memory synchronization from remaining indefinitely in a non-terminal state by adding worker timeout recovery, note progress, task-health reporting, and automatic interface polling.

ZBRANO v0.13.17 separates local appointments/reminders and Google Calendar synchronization into explicit backend domains while preserving routes, OAuth state, sync tokens, reminder delivery, worker lifecycle, and stored calendar data.

ZBRANO v0.13.16 moves the stateful Automation Brain and Notification Center engines into explicit backend domain modules while preserving their routes, shared watch storage, lifecycle, and persisted data formats.

ZBRANO v0.13.15 begins the canonical architecture split by extracting ordered frontend assets, API schemas, the Home Assistant transport, and low-coupling backend services while preserving `app.main:app`, API routes, stored data formats, and existing behavior.

ZBRANO v0.13.14 correctly decodes structured MCP results and tool errors, compacts only ZBRANO-managed v0.13 release blocks into concise descriptions, and prevents Release History from exceeding Workshop Memory's note-size limit.

ZBRANO v0.13.13 verifies ambiguous Workshop Memory release-note writes by reading the saved note back, preventing successful reconciliation from being reported as a missing-status failure.

ZBRANO v0.13.12 refreshes the application navigation, nested menus, cards, forms, and data tables with a cleaner modern visual system while preserving the established chat experience and all existing behavior.

ZBRANO v0.13.11 links Home Assistant Areas to geographic Zones through site Labels, applies label-defined entity roles and safety boundaries, and keeps learned room context aligned when HA organization changes.

ZBRANO v0.13.10 adds Home Assistant Area awareness and a local passive-learning loop that discovers room-level opportunities, suggests safe actions from evidence, and learns from approval, dismissal, and explicit preferences.

ZBRANO v0.13.9 adds an Automation Brain workflow that turns natural-language requests into reviewable structured drafts, remembers confirmed entity mappings, separates Create New from Library, and speaks only the configured suggestion wording.

ZBRANO v0.13.8 restores independent vertical and horizontal scrolling in the Entities inventory and keeps the History view bounded inside the panel.

ZBRANO v0.13.7 lets either Talk or the opted-in local “Hey ZBRANO” detector interrupt response generation and playback, then safely opens microphone capture for a replacement prompt.

ZBRANO v0.13.6 prevents cancelled microphone starts from reinstalling stale listeners, re-arms short or failed captures, and actively reconnects conversation listening when any browser audio component stops responding.

ZBRANO v0.13.5 prepares the first natural phrase while response text is still arriving, prefetches later speech, and starts adjusted-rate audio once an adaptive safety buffer and sustainable download rate are available.

ZBRANO v0.13.4 keeps adjusted-rate speech stable by fully buffering it before playback, locking the chosen rate when audio metadata loads, and avoiding speed changes in the middle of a spoken segment.

ZBRANO v0.13.3 verifies and recovers the live microphone path before showing conversation follow-up listening, prevents stale noise calibration from suppressing speech capture, and adds an adjustable 0.80×–1.40× speech playback speed.

ZBRANO v0.13.2 preserves the beginning of each spoken command, reliably re-arms follow-up conversation capture, cleans up expired listening windows, and centers compact microphone-RMS-responsive sound bars above the prompt without adding a visual frame.

ZBRANO v0.13.1 keeps voice interaction inside the chat workspace with a compact listening animation, recognizes configured conversation-closing phrases across common transcription variants, and finalizes spoken commands promptly after real post-speech silence without allowing steady room noise to prolong capture.

ZBRANO v0.13.0 promotes the complete generated application into canonical source. The image now builds directly from the reviewed backend and frontend instead of reconstructing the product through 147 historical patch scripts, while preserving the validated v0.12.112 behavior.

ZBRANO v0.12.112 captures spoken commands after local wake activation and groups the always-listening, local-model activation, and conversation controls together in the hands-free settings.

ZBRANO v0.12.111 optionally lets the local Hey ZBRANO model open the command interface and provides a bounded hands-free follow-up conversation window after voice-originated replies.

ZBRANO v0.12.110 removes the full-screen horizontal scanline overlay from every theme while preserving the neural background and functional component borders.

ZBRANO v0.12.109 installs the real-room-trained Hey ZBRANO v2 wake model for silent shadow evaluation, improving validated personal wake-phrase detection from 10/21 to 20/21 while retaining non-activation safety.

ZBRANO v0.12.108 repairs the validated wake-calibration image build by replacing a punctuation-dependent legacy source match with an encoding-independent patch boundary.

ZBRANO v0.12.107 waits for actual speech during wake calibration, validates recording quality before saving, audits existing samples, and removes or excludes silence, weak audio, and clipping without deleting valid recordings.

ZBRANO v0.12.106 separates microphone delivery from model recognition with live RMS/peak measurements and bounded phrase tests, and exports preserved calibration recordings as a structured ZIP for Hey ZBRANO v2 training.

ZBRANO v0.12.105 restores the broader base wake model by default, makes the trained personal verifier an explicit opt-in filter, and allows deleting only the verifier while preserving every recorded calibration clip.

ZBRANO v0.12.104 separates wake-sample uploads from the static verifier-training endpoint so Train personal verifier cannot be misrouted as an audio label, and renders structured API failures as readable messages instead of `[object Object]`. Existing private calibration samples are preserved.

ZBRANO v0.12.103 adds explicit personal wake calibration: 20 user-triggered Hey ZBRANO recordings, 20 user-triggered ordinary-speech recordings, optional false-trigger evidence, local verifier training, persistent private add-on storage, and verifier-aware shadow evaluation. No calibration audio is saved unless its recording or false-trigger button is pressed.

ZBRANO v0.12.102 bundles OpenWakeWord's shared ONNX mel-spectrogram and embedding models and loads them from explicit local paths, repairing the v0.12.101 shadow detector startup failure without adding network inference or audio retention.

ZBRANO v0.12.101 adds calibrated RMS-plus-peak voice detection, an independent recording hard stop, explicit audio finalization, non-speech transcript rejection, and a silent local OpenWakeWord shadow test with live confidence and false-detection statistics. Shadow mode never activates chat, retains no audio, and makes no OpenAI transcription request.

ZBRANO v0.12.100 makes the bounded reliable wake listener Chrome's primary path, exposes voice-detection stages, and prevents noise-triggered transcription bursts through an unbiased wake endpoint, stronger speech gating, hallucination rejection, and cooldown controls.

ZBRANO v0.12.99 creates and finalizes a fresh browser audio container for each detected wake utterance, preventing corrupt transcription uploads, and removes the obsolete voice/history helper label to reclaim composer width.

ZBRANO v0.12.98 adds a bounded reliable wake fallback: local browser voice activity detection transcribes only short detected utterances when Chrome returns no speech result, with an hourly safety limit and no retained audio.

ZBRANO v0.12.97 repairs Chrome wake activation by matching interim recognition, the configured phrase, and conservative phonetic forms of ZBRANO while displaying what Chrome heard.

ZBRANO v0.12.96 presents an animated, accessible listening overlay after the wake phrase is detected, including recognized-command feedback, timeout progress, and cancellation.

ZBRANO v0.12.95 repairs Entities scrolling, replaces the obsolete Workshop Memory session-draft write with an approval-safe downloadable entity-inventory update draft, and stops unsupported Brave wake recognition from cycling continuously.

ZBRANO v0.12.94 speaks newly generated autonomous suggestions, accepts a short spoken approve-or-decline response, and adds an optional browser wake phrase for hands-free commands while ZBRANO remains open.

ZBRANO v0.12.93 makes History reliably populate from approved current-state evidence as well as live changes, and correctly confirms climate activation when Home Assistant reports an HVAC mode such as `cool` instead of generic `on`.

ZBRANO v0.12.92 fixes an empty History and Event Timeline after device control by always prioritizing entities from the live state-change journal, merging them with the current selection, and displaying live-capture connection and journal counts.

ZBRANO v0.12.91 migrates two-way Telegram replies from the deprecated `target` field to `chat_id` and adds consistent searchable Home Assistant entity pickers throughout Automations, including multi-entity signal selection.

ZBRANO v0.12.90 activates the event-driven Real Automation Engine with structured triggers, presence checks, cooldowns, rate limits, evidence-backed suggestions, approval controls, and selectively autonomous reversible actions. It also repairs History and Event Timeline with an immediate live-event journal, resilient Recorder/Logbook merging, correct entity-ID mapping, automatic recent-activity loading, adds appointment deletion to the Month view, and uses dark-green completed reminders in the light theme.

ZBRANO v0.12.88 carries reminder state into the Month view: each appointment inside a day shows Pending, Completed, Attention, or No reminder, while selected-day cards show aggregate status and individual reminder badges.

ZBRANO v0.12.89 adds a secure two-way Telegram Inbox using Home Assistant event subscriptions, one-time chat pairing, persistent Telegram conversations, deterministic remote commands, and a separate remote-approval policy. Home Assistant continues to own the bot token, and idle monitoring never calls the AI model. It also includes v0.12.88 Month-view reminder status indicators and the v0.12.87 reminder history improvements.

ZBRANO v0.12.86 adds preview-first two-way Google Calendar synchronization through the standard Calendar API. Google events appear in ZBRANO's visual calendar, future ZBRANO appointments can be uploaded, linked cancellations propagate, and local Notification Center or Telegram reminders remain independent. Gmail and Calendar use separate OAuth grants and least-privilege scope sets.

ZBRANO v0.12.76 adds bounded, read-only Home Assistant History and Event Timeline intelligence: Recorder trends, Logbook search, multi-entity correlation, deterministic anomaly summaries, a visual timeline workspace, real diagnostics, and isolated chat routing for approved entities. v0.12.75 compacts the header, navigation, and chat composer to give conversations more space.

ZBRANO v0.12.72 improves natural voice prosody by preserving real punctuation, combining short phrases, and avoiding artificial TTS request boundaries at ordinary spaces while retaining streamed playback and next-segment prefetch.

ZBRANO v0.12.71 adds a dedicated Calendar with conversational appointment creation, upcoming and reminder views, a compact header shortcut, and scheduled Notification Center delivery through configured channels such as Telegram.

ZBRANO v0.12.70 keeps voice playback starting while response text is still streaming and pre-generates the next spoken segment during current playback, removing the multi-second pause between sentence-sized TTS requests.

ZBRANO v0.12.69 routes grinder freeze, reboot, telemetry, and incident prompts exclusively to the local read-only grinder diagnostic tools. It retrieves the stored pre-failure window instead of asking for an export and treats a later manual POWER ON reset as operator-caused when the user identifies it that way.
